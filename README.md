AWS SDK for elm
===============

__Experimental: Work in progress__

This will be generated.

The plan is to generate the elm code from the [AWS SDK for JavaScript][] package.
It contains [apis/*.json][] describing all the types and functions used in the SDK.

[apis/*.json]:https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/tree/master/apis
[AWS SDK for JavaScript]:https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js
